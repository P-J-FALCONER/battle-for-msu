# What does the program mean to you?
I owe a lot to this program.  It will forever be a significant part of my life and it is where I met some of my closest friends and 4 of my groomsmen.  At a time when a lot of people didn’t necessarily think I could recover from a significant injuries as the result of an auto accident, the MSU coaches stuck with me. I went on to prove to myself and to them that they made the right decision after placing top 4 at the Ohio State Swimming championships.  I now drive around Cincinnati, OH proudly displaying my “MICH ST” license plate because of my belief that green and white are truly the only colors.  


# Why did you choose MSU?
I loved the camaraderie of the team on my official visit and realized that it was the most complete package for me as a student and an athlete.  I had been in talks with Univ. of Cincinnati, Ohio State, Clemson, Purdue and others.   Looking back, I know I picked the absolute best school and I am so proud to wear my green and white.  

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

With time, commitment and a strong team around you, you can achieve just about anything.
