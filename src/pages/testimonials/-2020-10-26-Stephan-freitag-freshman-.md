# What does the program mean to you?
Ever since I was a little kid I’ve always wanted to be a spartan. Since the day I stared swimming it was my dream. I had a meet in the outdoor pool one and bought a michigan state swimming quarter zip, I still have it to this day. Resembling a dream come true, a childhood dream. I never expected to make it this far in my career but am so proud of myself for accomplishing my dreams. This program means the world to me and gave me everything I have today. I don’t know where I would be without it. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
It has always been my School I have 2 other siblings here so it’s basically home. The spartan logo is something to live for and thats what I want. My heart and soul go into the spartan logo and I would never choose anywhere else.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I’m learning how to manage my time in school swim and social life. Also teaches you a lot about people and what they thrive for. I’ve met so many new and awesome teammates it taught me to respect each other and what everyone does.
