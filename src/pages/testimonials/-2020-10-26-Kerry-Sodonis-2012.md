# What does the program mean to you?
When I think of the MSU swimming and diving program, I am filled with a deep sense of pride. Seeing how quickly and fiercly a huge amount of alumni rallied around the current team to save the program speaks volumes about the impact that being a part of this team has had on all of our lives. Your teammates and coaches see your struggles and successes in and out of the pool and are there to support you every step of the way. Everyone understands the hard work, determination, and grit it takes to be a part of the program and we are strongly connected because of it. Though it's been years since I've competed, this program will always be family. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
For the high level of both academics and athletics.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Success isn't always measured in medals and times. Showing up, putting in the work when things get hard, and being there to support your team or those you care about are going to matter far longer than any awards and accolades.
