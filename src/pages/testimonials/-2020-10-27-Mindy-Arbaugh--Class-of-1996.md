# What does the program mean to you?
The MSU Swimming and Diving program was the transition from my childhood to adulthood. It was a family that welcomed me warmly as a young freshman, then demanded of me more than anyone ever had, producing a capable and confident adult. I learned about myself, about working with a diverse group, about meeting multiple expectations. And I met a lifelong support group, one that helped me through college, and one that has continued to support each other through life. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I fell in love with the gorgeous campus, with the feel of a Big 10 school, and with the Spartans I met. The decision to walk-on as a swimmer came late, but it was easily the best part of my experience at Michigan State.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

The MSU Swimming and Diving program revealed in me a capacity to do more than I ever imagined. A capacity to succeed in the classroom, in the pool, and in life. The lessons of discipline, pride, hard work and balance showed that I can handle far more than I thought possible.
