# What does the program mean to you?
I have worked so hard to make it here.  This team is a group of extraordinary, hardworking, and academically centered team composed of diverse individuals that each bring something to the table.  The program means grind, dedication, family, and a place of comfort.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU for the great academics and athletics, especially after my official visit where I woke up in the dorms on the last day and knew “this is where I belong”

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

While my time has been limited to half a semester thus far, I have witnessed great leadership and inclusiveness within the team.  No one is excluded and everyone is cared for and made sure they are doing well within their athletics, academics, and lives
