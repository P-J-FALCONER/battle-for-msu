# What does the program mean to you?
It is nearly impossible to put into words what this program means to me. It is simply everything I could have ever hoped for in a college experience. My teammates have become family in just four short years. The people I have been surrounded by have shaped me into the best version of myself and for that this program will always hold a special place in my heart.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose Michigan State University because even from the short time I was visiting during my recruiting trip, I could sense the dynamic of the team was unmatched. I could tell the coaches valued success outside of the pool as much as they valued success in the pool. There was a sense of support and endearment amongst the team I knew I wouldn't get anywhere else. I knew by coming here, I would be surrounded by like-minded people and an overwhelming amount of resources to thrive. If I were to go back in time and do it all over again, I would always choose MSU.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Never take any moment of your life for granted. Even on the worst of days, there will always be something you will look back to in the future.
