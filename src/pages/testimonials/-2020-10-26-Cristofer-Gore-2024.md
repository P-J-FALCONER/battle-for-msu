# What does the program mean to you?
Everything. For the short time I have been on campus and training with my team, it’s been the most enjoyable time of my life. I’ve created lifelong friendships in such a short time. I’ve also never had such a friendly and inviting coaching staff as the one here at MSU.


# Why did you choose MSU?
The coaching staff and the people I met on my official visit

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Don’t take anything for granted
