# What does the program mean to you?
The program was my instant family away from home.  It gave me some of the best experiences of my life with travel, relationships, Varsity Club community work and interaction with other sports teams.  The team was a source of strength, community and humor and has remained a touchstone to MSU, all these years later.


# Why did you choose MSU?
MSU was an hour from my hometown and my teenage coach contacted the MSU coach, who invited me to campus for a visit.  While I was not provided a scholarship, I chose MSU to be part of such a great university.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Life is full of difficult choices, which you can navigate successfully, particularly with the support of friends.  Work for what you want.  You never know who your next life-long friend may be.  Embrace the opportunities you meet.
