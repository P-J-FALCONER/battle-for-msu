# What does the program mean to you?
This program, more than anything else, means family to me. This team is a community of caring, resourceful, responsible individuals who work everyday to balance their passion for their athletic and academic success, while still maintaining/partaking in some of the most fulfilling relationships and experiences I could ever hope to ask for. This program defines my collegiate experience, and this program, and the people within it, are my family for life.  


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU for the community and environment that the MSU Swimming and Diving program provided. I felt that this unique group of people, their values and their passions were not able to be replicated at any other program in the nation. This team, with its encompassing focus on athletics, academics, and the community around us, is the reason I chose Spartan Swimming and Diving. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

To cherish the experiences you get to have and to never take anything for granted;  tomorrow, your whole world can collapse in the blink of an eye, changing your life forever, so live in the present, for the future is always uncertain.
