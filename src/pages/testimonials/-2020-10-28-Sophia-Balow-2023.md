# What does the program mean to you?
This program gave me a home away from home at Michigan State. My friends and teammates have become my family. My experience here has been second to none, and I truly love what I'm doing, who I am with, and where I am. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because I felt it was the best mix of academics and athletics for me. The opportunities at MSU are endless and I felt they would best prepare me for life post graduation. Furthermore, throughout the recruiting process I met numerous swimming and diving teams. Michigan State was, by far, the most tight-knit and supportive team I met. I knew that it was a special place with a special team and I feel so grateful to be a part of it.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I think the biggest life-lesson I am learning is to never underestimate the value of hard work. This applies to the pool, the classroom, and beyond. Being a B1G Student-Athlete comes with a new set of challenges, but anything is possible when you set your mind to it.
