# What does the program mean to you?
I only swam with the team for a year and it has made a lasting impact. From this program, I have made life-long friends. From tough practices, to team events, to volunteering, the swim and dive team has a bond like no other. And not only did the coaches contribute to making you a better swimmer/diver, but a better human being. This team is truly a family.
I also was able to watch both of my sisters swim for State. I watched them earn letterman jackets and I watched them finish their senior year at B1Gs with best times.
I think it shows something special when you have a team with multiple sets of siblings, or a younger athlete following in an older siblings footsteps. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
Both the school and the team felt like home. I knew in the event my swimming career ended, that I would be happy at State.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Never stop setting goals, never stop giving your best.
