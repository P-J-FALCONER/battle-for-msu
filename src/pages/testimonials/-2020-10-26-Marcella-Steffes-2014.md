# What does the program mean to you?
Being part of the MSU program was so much more than a just swim team. It taught me how to mentally persevere, how to be a leader, & how to believe in myself. This program helped me grow into the woman I am today by demanding the best of me when I didn’t think it was possible. If it weren’t for swimming, I wouldn’t have attended MSU & gone on to meet some of my best friends, and the greatest mentors in my life. Those individuals were my family away from home. They even introduced me to the network within the packaging industry, which directly ties to where I work today. I am forever indebted to the program.
