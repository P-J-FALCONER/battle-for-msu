# What does the program mean to you?
The MSU swim and dive program means the WORLD to me. It gave me immediate friends that I can now call family, coaches that I am proud to call mine, a support system, and the opportunity to compete as a D1 athlete in a sport that I have dedicated my entire life to. Representing Michigan State has been an honor and I will forever be proud to call myself a Spartan swimmer. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose Michigan State because of the campus vibes, the amazing school spirit, the swim team culture, and the coaching staff (Coach G and Kathleen). I simply felt at home when I stepped on campus. Coach G and Coach Kathleen are honest, generous, understanding, and truly some of the kindest people. They genuinely care about each and every athlete and I felt that immediately after meeting them. They emphasize the importance of school work, taught me to be a team player, and most importantly taught me the values of being a Spartan. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Michigan State has taught me what it means to be a student athlete. Learning to balance school work and swimming, learning to compete for the TEAM, and learning to love swimming even more than I already did.
