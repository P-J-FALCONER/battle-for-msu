# What does the program mean to you?
This program is my family. The people I have met here because of swimming are truly wonderful people. I couldn't imagine where I would be without them. They all have taught me so much about life and myself. Also they've showed me what it means to be a Spartan. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because when I came on my official visit and got to see first hand how close this team is, I immediately wanted to be a part if it. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

The biggest life lesson I have learned is to never give up no matter how hard it gets. There is always another way to get through it and there is always someone who can help you.
