# What does the program mean to you?
It means everything, it’s the biggest reason why I came to MSU. I came to further my career and contribute to the team. To get faster and grow in relationship with my teammates and coaches. MSU gave me the opportunity to be a division 1 collegiate athlete. You can’t just take that away from someone. It means everything to me. I feel like I speak for all my teammates when I say that without swimming at state a lot of us feel like we’ve lost our identity because swimming is all we’ve ever know and what we’ve dedicated our life’s work to.


# Why did you choose MSU?
It was the best fit for me academically and athletically. I fell in love with the campus and coaching staff as well as my teammates. It felt like a family and it felt like a place where I belonged which has now been taken away.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Not everything comes easy. But things that matter must be earned and sometimes you get let down in life but you have to get back up and keep fighting.
