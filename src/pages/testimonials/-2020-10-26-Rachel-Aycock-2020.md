# What does the program mean to you?
This program means the world to me and so does the school. My family has had many members go to MSU and my sister swam on the team. So this school and team means so much to me in terms of family. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
It felt like home. When I went on all my visits, i would compare them all to MSU. I just knew this was home. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

That college is an adjustment and itâ€™s all about time management while having fun.
