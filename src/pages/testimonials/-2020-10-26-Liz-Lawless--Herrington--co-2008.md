# What does the program mean to you?
Diving for MSU and Eric Best was a dream come true. The best thing to come from my participation with the program was meeting my lifelong best friends - Brittany Ghiroli, Lindsay Bockstiegel, and Amber Rodin. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
My parents are both class of 1976 and met at Brody as freshmen. There was never another school for me. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Solidarity, friendship, and hard work are so much more important than anything else!
