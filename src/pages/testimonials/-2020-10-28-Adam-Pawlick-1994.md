# What does the program mean to you?
In short, everything.  This program is honestly the only reason I attended MSU....I grew up as a UM fan, but after meeting my teammates on the recruiting trip, seeing the campus, I fell in love.  And I am blessed, because that decision set in motion a huge number of events in my life and shaped who I am as a person, as a leader, and as a father.


# Why did you choose MSU?
MSU felt like home almost immediately during my recruiting trip.  I took all 5 official visits to schools like UM, PSU, Northwestern, UNC and MSU and tons of unofficial visits.  The only school that felt like home was MSU.  It had the worst facilities of all the schools I looked at, but it had the best teammates that truly supported each other, even back then, like brothers and sisters.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I learned that the definition of success isn't always measured in wins and losses, its measured by the amount of work you put into something and the drive to improve, no matter the situation or the limitations.
