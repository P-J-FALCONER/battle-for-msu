# What does the program mean to you?
This program has never given up on me. With that said, I will not give up on this program.  With an amazing staff that has provided so much for us along with my teammates that have given me experiences that will be life-long memories, I will not let the foundation of our experiences be ripped away from all of us.  


# Why did you choose MSU?
I never thought I’d be given the chance to represent a Big Ten school through athletics. MSU showed me that this school believes in a balance with academics and athletics; both are and should be important to the student-athlete. Also, this school doesn’t let any great work go unrecognized; when I was told that they hosted an annual Academic Gala to recognize the amazing work the athletes put into the classroom, I knew that it was the place for me. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I’m learning that truly nothing is impossible; I didn’t think I’d be able to make it through all the years of swimming, but by never losing hope and pushing through the long distance sets and pace sets, I can do anything I put my mind to (in and out of the pool).
