# What does the program mean to you?
Despite only being here for a short time, I would do anything for my teammates and coaches, my family. I love this team with my whole heart.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because the second I stepped foot on campus for my visit I knew it was the place for me. The team was fun and exciting. Everyone was extremely kind, and made me feel welcome and at home.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Donâ€™t take anything for granted, and never ever take no as an answer.
