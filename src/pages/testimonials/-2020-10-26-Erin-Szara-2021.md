# What does the program mean to you?
Michigan State swimming gave me a place to excel in and out of the pool.  The coaches along with my teammates have always pushed me to do my very best and they motivate me everyday.  I got the spartan head tattooed on my back because I wouldn't want to swim anywhere else.  I am proud to swim for MSU and represent them at the Olympic Trials in June 2021.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I actually was a UofM fan back in high school, and I started crying when Coach G called me and asked me to come visit because I didn't want to come!  But I came and Ellie Roche showed me around campus and I met Coach Kathleen and some other members of the team and instantly fell in love.  The campus was beautiful and after talking with the coaches I knew they could lead me to become the nationally ranked breaststroker that I am today.  I wouldn't have chose any other school than MSU.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Don't take anything for granted.  Although we might not have the biggest pool or the fanciest weight room, that didn't matter to me.  And now all of that is going to be taken away from my teammates and I.  I am heartbroken knowing that I could very well be one of the last swimmers to graduate from MSU.
