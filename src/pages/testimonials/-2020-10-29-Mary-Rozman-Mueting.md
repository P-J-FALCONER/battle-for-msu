# What does the program mean to you?
To me it is the best overall big swimming college program in our wonderful water-loving state of Michigan. It developed me and so many young student-athletes to become the best they can be in and out of the pool. I was fortunate to swim at MSU in the 1980â€™s. Through the program I grew as a student-athlete tremendously in ability and courage and work ethic. I tore my ACL as a freshman but through the support and love of this team I learned to persevere and achieve through this and other challenges. I have many swimmer friends who swam at other big schools but none had the wonderful bond that this program gives to those lucky enough to swim and dive at MSU. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I wanted to continue to grow as a student athlete at a strong Michigan state university. MSU showed me they were a family of athletes away from home. It was also a chance for me to swim again with my sister Sally.  What a wonderfully strong and balanced program for the many swimming families in our state. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Perseverance, courage, true support of each other and self discipline
