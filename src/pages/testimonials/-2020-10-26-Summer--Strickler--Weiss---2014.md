# What does the program mean to you?
This program has a special place in my heart. It taught me how to lead, be a teammate, follow my dreams, and how to push through when times get tough. Truly representing the green & white every day is something that cannot be replicated.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I wanted to be part of a program that truly cared about each other more than themselves. This team supports each other in the pool and the classroom unlike any other program I have ever seen. The 65-year ran alumni meet proves that the support continues past graduation. FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Never give up on yourself. When times get tough and all you want to do is quit, always push through. You never know what you are truly capable of achieving until you overcome your limits.
