# What does the program mean to you?
This program means so much to me! This program gave me the ability to continue my swimming career in college. I learned hard work ethic and how to bring that work ethic into my career. I also met by closest and best friends on the swim team while I was at MSU.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because of the team and coaching staff. The team became my family and the staff pushed me to reach goals and dreams I hadnâ€™t even imagined until I had begun my time there.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

The biggest life lesson I learned is to always put my absolute all into everything I do. I learned how to never give up and to keep pushing myself and my limits would start to disappear. I brought this into my classes and my professional career as I have faced many challenges through out both.
