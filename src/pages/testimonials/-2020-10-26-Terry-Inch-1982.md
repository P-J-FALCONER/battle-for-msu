# What does the program mean to you?
The operating norms I learned/developed while swimming for MSU became foundational cornerstones of the successes I achieved in my personal and professional life. Discipline, hard work, sense of team and communtity that allowed me to retire at age 57 and give generously to the University and MSU athletics over the years.


# Why did you choose MSU?
Fell in love with the University the first time I stepped on campus for the Michigan State Swim Cphampionships in high school. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I've learned there isn't anything that can't be accomplished with hard work, discipline and teamwork.
