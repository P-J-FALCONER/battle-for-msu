# What does the program mean to you?
The program means my best friends, my career (livelihood), and my drive to always want better for myself. Not a day goes by without lamenting on a memory of something that happened while swimming at MSU.


# Why did you choose MSU?
MSU was a place that allowed me to be an engineering major while competing at the highest level. After a cross-country college search, I found the best place for me was only an hour away.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Approaching situations with confidence in yourself makes all the difference. Your chances of succeeding athletically, academically,  and in the workforce is greatly increased.
