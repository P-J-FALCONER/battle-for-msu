# What does the program mean to you?
MSU swimming in many ways, is Michigan State to me. The start of lifetime friendships and of following my passions. MSU Swimming provided a building block for transitioning the grit needed for sport beyond the pool and into academics and then later work. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU:
-To swim wearing green and white.
-For the team camaraderie MSU swimming & diving demonstrated
-For the opportunity to be a student athlete on team that promoted greatness in academics & sport

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

MSU Swimming taught me the values of team, perseverance, determination, hard work, trust & friendship. I have leaned on these experiences as I gained a doctoral degree, and later working in leadership roles in health centers/medical practices & now as an owner of a multidisciplinary health practice.
