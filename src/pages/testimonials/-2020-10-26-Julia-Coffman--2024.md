# What does the program mean to you?
Everything, swimming has been my life since I was 5 and it has been the one constant thing Iâ€™ve had. Swimming had given me purpose when I struggled to find it. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because of the people and the atmosphere here. The decision was much more then just a swim team. It was the people, the team, East Lansing, and the education. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

How to be myself and be perfectly ok with who I am.
