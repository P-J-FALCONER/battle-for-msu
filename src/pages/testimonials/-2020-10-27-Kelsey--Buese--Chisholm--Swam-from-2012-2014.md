# What does the program mean to you?
My life would not be where it is today without this program. I learned more about myself in those 2 years than I ever could have imagined. My best memories are in that outdoor pool, working hard with my team. I was given so many amazing opportunities, in and out of the pool- something I will always be grateful for. This program is all about building yourself and your relationships- I made lifelong friends and I met my husband through this program. I never want to see this program go away because it means more to me than anyone could know.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I had always dreamed of swimming at a big school. Being from Kentucky, I thought SEC would be where I ended up. After my visit to MSU, my life was changed forever. There was something about that chilly Saturday morning in East Lansing, watching the team swim in the outdoor pool and hearing the band play loud and proud that hit me hard. It felt like a family, one that I instantly wanted to be a part of. I knew the facilities were not as nice as the other schools but that did not matter and never has to any MSU swimmer or diver. It is more than that; the culture, the challenge, the experience.  Swimmers work their entire lives to pursue a dream like that. Countless hours in the pool, early mornings and a determination like no other. MSU swimmers are some of the toughest- both mentally and physically and I could see that from my first visit and wanted to be part of that.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

MSU swimming taught me so many things. I won't lie, I was extremely challenged and had some really hard days. It is TOUGH work, but I first and foremost learned that I had an entire team and great coaches supporting me day in and day out. I learned to appreciate challenges, pain and wins/loses- all things that made me stronger and feel accomplished. Not only did MSU swimming teach me life lessons about hard work, but I also met lifelong friends and my husband on that team- this program holds a special place in my heart because it gave me my life and I will forever be grateful.
