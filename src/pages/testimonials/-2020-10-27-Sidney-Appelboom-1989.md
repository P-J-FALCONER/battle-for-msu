# What does the program mean to you?
It has made me become the person that I am.  

As a skinny Belgian swimmer MSU and its coaches developed me into an 2x All-American and Olympian at the 1988 Games. Through that experience I have coached 2 Olympians, and  have been to all the Olympic games since (Tokio should have been the 9th!!) as a colourcommentator for the Belgian TV, always sitting behind Rowdy Gaines. Besides that, witj the education MSU gave me I managed a successful family owned auctionhouse since 1992.

Not even mentioning the lasting friendships with former swimmers and coaches, the swimmingprogram gave a lot. 

I came in with a 1/4 scholarship and refused a full one my junior year so that the program could become a  better one. I must have been the cheapest All-American on campus!

I do get up at night (6 hours difference) to watch Izzoâ€™s team, but this will be with a complete different feeling if the swimming programs are abandoned.

Go Green Go white.
