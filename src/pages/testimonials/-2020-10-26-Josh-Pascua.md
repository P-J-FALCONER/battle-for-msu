# What does the program mean to you?
Everything, MSU swim and dive has given me a second family. These people and the memories Iâ€™ve made here are something I will carry with me the rest of my life.


# Why did you choose MSU?
The ability to swim for a Big 10 school and focus on academics as well as athletics. Also  taking a visit to MSU and seeing how close the team was helped to solidify my decision.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I learned the value of being a team player rather than trying to do everything myself.
