# What does the program mean to you?
The program means an opportunity to show your Spartan grit and power. Through the traditions of Spartan Swimming and Diving, you will learn true strength, the value of a supportive team, and through those lessons that you can do things that may even surprise yourself, because this team together can and SPARTANS WILL. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
I swam at MSU at sports camp and fell in love with the sport all over again, the MSU team and its grit and bond, and wanted to go to MSU. We moved to the area in the middle of high school and the MSU pool was quickly my Home and safe place. It is not much to look at, but it is a home filled with love and strength and support. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

That when you need to find strength in yourself, look to the others that care about you and recognize their strengths. We are all connected and will learn and grow with one another.
