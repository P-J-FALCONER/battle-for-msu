# What does the program mean to you?
This program is a big part of who I am today. It is part of my identity. I would not have my relationships, post-swimming career, and memories if it werenâ€™t for the MSU Swimming and Diving Team.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU because of the swim team.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

The biggest life-lesson I learned from MSU was to make the most of every opportunity that presents itself.
