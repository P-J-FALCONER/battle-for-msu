# What does the program mean to you?
It is an immediate family and support  system. It provided me the tools and the passion to become a swim coach and teacher. It provided the life skills and tools needed in the working world and collaborating as a team. 


# Why did you choose MSU?
It felt like home the minute I stepped on campus. It allowed me to be apart of a team and something bigger than myself. It provided me the opportunity to obtain a big ten degree along with swimming for a division 1 program. I felt supported by the swim coaches and academic coordinators. I felt it was the perfect place to grow and learn. 

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I learned how to handle adversity, to work for something long term, and to work towards a common goal with a team.
