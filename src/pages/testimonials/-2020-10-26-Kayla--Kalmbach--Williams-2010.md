# What does the program mean to you?
This program means more to me than any other aspect if my experience at MSU bar none. The skills and relationships I developed while a part of this program were instrumental in getting me to where I am today. Balancing the rigor of Chemical Engineering with a mentally demanding sport such as diving was difficult to be sure, but with the encouragement of my teammates and the coaching staff I learned I was capable of far more than I ever imagined. The friendships I developed and mentorship of my coaches and teammates are invaluable resourcs that I continue to draw upon to this day.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU for three reasons: I grew up in a spartan household, MSU has a good in-state chemical engineering program, and I wanted to continue diving in college. I knew coach Best from summer camps, knew I would enjoy working with him, and he was willing to let me walk on to the team.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

Never let the odds of success hold you back or stand in your way.

The phrase Spartans will really resonates with me. It speaks to the determination of our student athletes, and the Swim and Dive team embodies this phrase more than most. They have been achieving in spite of the obstacles and doing more with less for a long time. They perform well both in the classroom and in the pool. I would not be as successful as I am today without the opportunity to dive at MSU.
