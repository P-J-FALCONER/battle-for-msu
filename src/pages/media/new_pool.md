# What does the program mean to you?
This program has changed me for the better. My time as an MSU diver has helped me to grow as a person and improve my diving more than I ever thought possible in three years. I would not be who I am today without MSU Swim and Dive, and it is so heartbreaking that future generations of swimmers and divers will not get to experience this program that I love so much and has had such a positive impact on my life.


# Why did you choose MSU?
I chose MSU for many reasons. I knew I would be majoring in secondary education and it offered one of the best education programs in the country. I also was in contact with diving coach Eric Best throughout my entire high school diving career and I knew that he was a great coach and that we would work well together. I also loved that I would be able to focus on springboard diving (1m and 3m). Finally, my sister was on the MSU gymnastics team, and I could not pass up the opportunity to compete at the same Big Ten school with my sister. I knew from taking to her that being an MSU athlete was an amazing experience.

# Biggest life-lesson you are learning/learned from MSU?

I can overcome adversity and push myself to achieve things that I only dreamed were possible if I work hard enough. I have also learned how important it is to surround yourself with people who lift you up and will support you in who you are.
