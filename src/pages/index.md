    The decision to cut the men’s and women’s swimming and diving programs at Michigan State University after the 2020-2021 season is unjustified. We, as current student-athletes, alumni, Olympic sport supporters, and other friends of the team, disagree with this decision due to its lack of transparency, misleading claims, and failure to consider the unique and powerful experience MSU offers to student-athletes in these sports. Our goals are to establish a dialogue with the decision makers, correct the facts, become part of a creative solution, and reinstate the teams.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.
