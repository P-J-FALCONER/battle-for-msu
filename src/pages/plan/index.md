title: REINSTATEMENT PLAN OF ATTACK
---

1. Direct appeal to the board of trustees: going to get a spot and have been promised we will get a chance to present this Friday (10/30).
2. Going to clarify that IM West is a regulation sized pool in front of the board because they literally do not know this.
3. We are going to ask: is this a facility issue or a finance issue with the university. Once we get an answer here for this ask, we will have a place to direct the money. From here we create the GoFundMe and seek out every donor we know. Essentially- we need a number ($) and clarification of where this number is needed to sustain the program- i.e. pool or overall finances. Get university to agree to our terms before we raise money is the goal here.  
4. If raising money is out of the picture- we fight the Title IX legal fight- last resort but nonetheless an option. 
5. SOCIAL MEDIA PRESSURE. We are in the process of creating graphics to post “How can you support?” As well as what the “Game Plan” is to make our message clear and concise.
6. Lastly- we need to continue pressuring these people. We are constructing a template email to send to the board and we can have people copy this template, include their name, and send it their way. More information will be sent on this shortly as we finalize the email.
7. Continue following, sharing, liking, commenting and spreading the word with our social media accounts to increase awareness. If you know big names- get in contact with them and tell them to follow and share our stuff. Thank you all and go green.
