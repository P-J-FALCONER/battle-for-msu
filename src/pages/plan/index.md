### As members of the Battle for Spartan Swim and Dive, we will fight until this decision is overturned and these teams are reinstated. To achieve this, we shall take the following actions:

- **Establishing Dialogue** We hope to establish dialogue with the Board of Trustees, President, and AD to find out why this decision was actually made. We also hope to get a clear answer on what can be done to reinstate the programs.

- **Generating Public Support** The outpour of support on social media has been amazing. Our official accounts are [@BattleForSpartanSwimAndDive](https://www.instagram.com/battleforspartanswimanddive/) on Instagram, [@BattleForMSU](https://twitter.com/battleformsu) on Twitter, and the group [Battle for Spartan Swim and Dive](https://www.facebook.com/groups/791545761418249) on Facebook. Countless olympians, professional swimmers, and other university sports teams have shown support. Media attention, both locally and nationally will be generated. A campaign to distribute masks with images of The Rock on them has been started.

- **Correcting the Facts** Most importantly, our pool is completely compliant with NCAA regulations for existing facilities. We’d also like to set the record straight that our alumni ARE having world-class experiences, as seen in their testimonials found on the [MSUSwim YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/user/MSUswim/videos)

- **Facility Planning** Properly exploring PPP funding routes. Additionally, working with ASMSU to push forward with starting an assessed recreation and wellness fee. -->

## After almost 2.5 years of work, MSU's University Advancement Office, which oversees donations to Michigan State, has been directed by the President to collect official pledges toward the reinstatement of both Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving teams. Our understanding is that several lead donors have given us a great head start toward a viable reinstatement milestone and validating our original pledges will get us close. With the recent political climate at MSU we believe our window of opportunity is NOW, so let’s join the University and #GiveGreen this week for Spartan Swimming and Diving
