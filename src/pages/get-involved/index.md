Dear **[Insert name here]**,

I am reaching out today to express my extreme disappointment in the decision to discontinue the Michigan State Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving programs. After carefully reading Athletic Director Beekman’s statement and watching his interview, I am struggling to understand how this decision was reached.

First, in Athletic Director Beekman’s statement there are several inaccuracies that I’d like to address. First and foremost is the suggestion that our IM facilities limit the talent that our coaches can recruit and that they do not provide an atmosphere to allow our athletes to maximize their potential. Michigan State Swim and Dive has produced many outstanding student-athletes, below you can find a list of past and current accomplishments from the team, both in and out of the pool. Please note that in order to keep this correspondence short I’ve selected a few accolades that speak strongly against Beekman’s statement. That being said there are many more outside of what is listed here that I’d love to share if you’re interested.

**[Insert desired accolades here, to keep the email concise we suggest 5-10 that speak strongly to you personally. List of accolades: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9ApB2izBcZMzSpSPwR_r3GMxjQhtwKt6cjuXnbFRuc/edit?usp=sharing]**

Additionally, Athletic Director Beekman stated that with the recent (and unfortunate) closure of the outdoor pool at IM West the team no longer has a regulation sized pool. This is simply not true. Since the 1950s all NCAA regulated meets have been completed via short-course, which requires “the racing course be 75 feet [22.86 m] in length by 30 feet [9.15 m] in width, providing for at least five, 6-foot [1.83 m] lanes.” This is the size of our current indoor pool at IM West.

Next, I would like to address the financial aspect of the decision. When looking at the number of student-athletes on the team who are currently on partial scholarship or no scholarship at all, the Swimming and Diving program is a net revenue generator for the University based on non-scholarship tuition. This is not taking into account any additional donations or support that comes from our loyal alumni, from which there is very strong support. In fact, in 2018-2019, $1.1 million of the $1.6 million cost of the programs was paid back to the university as financial aid.

Lastly, it is no secret that the state of the IM West facilities leave a lot to be desired. However, the facilities should not be given as a reason to cut this program. All of the student-athletes (past and present) understood where they would be training before coming to Michigan State. While new, shiny updated facilities would be great, and something for the University to strive towards for all students at Michigan State, these student-athletes have demonstrated time and again that the facilities do not make the program. Rather, they are proof of the talent, hard work, and heart that these student-athletes possess. Testimonial compilations are available here: https://youtu.be/RAZfnFYWG6o and here: https://youtu.be/4HG23uuoqeg, with all the individual testimonies on the MSUSwim YouTube channel.

Based on the facts outlined above, I am asking that you reconsider and reinstate the team.

Or at the very least give the current team members, your loyal alumni, and other fierce supporters a chance to try and raise the necessary funds and save the program we love, and that has a long storied history at Michigan State University. It costs you nothing to let us try. **[Personalize here with any connection to MSU Swim and dive, Spartan athletics, or the sports in general]**
