### About
Michigan State has had a Mens Swimming Program for 93 Years and the Womens program just turned 51. On October 24th the team was called in for a quick call from the AD. Within just a few minutes it was annouced that Michigan State would cut both mens and womens swim and dive teams. The atheltic departments reasonings for cutting the program were riddled with lies and false statements about the program and its facilities. 

Quickly after the anouncement spread from the team to the alumnus, we bagn to organize quickly to plan a way to get our beloved program reinstated.
