## #SaveOlympicSports

### Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Olympic sports at universities around the country have seen a significant uptick in cuts, with administrations citing financial deficits and revenue losses related to the coronavirus. Ninety three Division I teams have been cut so far, 11 of which are aquatic teams. Even amid the growing cuts, many athletes have refused to give up without a fight. Below are some of the sports that have been cut and links to their resources to help support their fights.
